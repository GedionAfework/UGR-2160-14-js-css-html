              During this time, I was a student at LCCS. Then, I got sick twice.
              In the summer of 2005, I got my appendix out. Then, in the winter
              of 2007, I got diagnosed with Hepitites B. I was at home for 2
              months and returned back to school. It was hard to get back on
              track, but I had to put more effort than usual. I also was a
              member of several clubs like: Science club, Sport club, Chess
              club, Music club. I along with my friends did a lot for our school
              and won compitions for it.

                friendships. At first, I dropped my school and forgot about it.
                Then, my parents told me that I need this and we discussed about
                it. Then, I went back to school. To be honest, if I could change
